# Hello---World
This is a test repository that I'm making. Seriously, I had no idea that this things is what created those fancy guides of how to install software into Linux. It's all done in a text editor, but somehow the end result is a more formidible looking text. This is a nice way to learn how to branch off the master branch as well. Can I add pictures, nice bullet points, or other different things? That, I am unsure of. But, what I do know is that the left panel of the PC I built while I was sick is literally shoving in all those PSU wires. I have no idea how the pc isn't overheating. I'm looking at it right now and it's kind of crazy how it works. And I just realized this whole paragraph was in one single line-space (line-2). How is that even possible? It's already many lines long. This whole thing is confusing, but I will learn it. Testing done.
